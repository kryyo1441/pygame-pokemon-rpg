## Quick Start

Getting the game running is super simple:
1. Open your terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to the project folder and install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Navigate to the code folder:
   ```
   cd code
   ```
4. Run the game:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## How It Works üîÑ

Here's a flowchart of the game's main systems:

## Implemented Features

* World exploration system
* Trainer battle mechanics
* Monster progression system
* Turn-based combat implementation
* Battle animation framework
* Dialog interaction system
* Monster database interface

## Technical Challenges

* **Collision System**: Implementation of collision detection presents ongoing challenges due to the complexity of multiple collision layers (NPCs, objects, transitions). Current implementation requires optimization and bug fixes.

* **Battle Logic**: The battle system's complexity, involving extensive game data management (monsters, moves, stats), presents significant synchronization challenges. Current implementation requires additional error handling and state management improvements.

* **Game State Management**: Transition management between overworld, battles, and menu states presents substantial complexity in maintaining consistent game state. Current implementation requires enhanced state validation and error recovery systems.

## Known Issues üêõ

* Collision detection can be unreliable in certain areas
* Some battle transitions might get stuck (just restart if this happens!)
* Monster stats might not always update correctly after battles
* Occasional visual glitches in battle animations

## Future Features üöÄ
